Concise is a lightweight, front-end framework that provides a number of great features without the bloat. Concise is built based on Object-Oriented CSS principles and keeps semantics in mind to provide a small learning curve, but a high level of customization.

Here you will find a collection of add-ons that are designed to aid in the creation of modular components, as well as provide extra features we did not find suited for the base framework.

## Documentation

What would a project be without great documentation? Concise has documentation for everything that is included in the framework. If you see something that is missing or incorrect, don't hesitate to open up an issue on our GitHub repo.
